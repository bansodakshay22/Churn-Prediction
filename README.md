# Churn-Prediction
Problem Statement:¶
Customer churn is a financial term that refers to the loss of a client or customer—that is, when a customer ceases to interact with a company or business. Similarly, the churn rate is the rate at which customers or clients are leaving a company within a specific period of time. A churn rate higher than a certain threshold can have both tangible and intangible effects on a company’s business success. Ideally, companies like to retain as many customers as they can.
How a bank can predict customer churn based on different customer attributes such as age, gender, geography, and more.
